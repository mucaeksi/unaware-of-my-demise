name: eval-harness
description: "Codex/UOMD adaptation. Eval-driven development (EDD) framework for AI coding sessions — define capability and regression evals before coding, grade with code-based, model-based, rule, or human graders, and track pass@k and pass^k reliability. Use when defining pass/fail criteria for agent tasks, measuring agent reliability, building regression suites for prompt or agent changes, or benchmarking across model versions."

# eval-harness — Codex adaptation

Read the [canonical skill](../../../.claude/skills/eval-harness/SKILL.md) in full before applying its workflow. Its source directory is `.claude/skills/eval-harness/`: resolve every relative reference, script and data path against that directory. This adapter deliberately reuses the pinned content instead of making another drifting copy.

Read root README and AGENTS.md. User/session instructions and runtime permissions take precedence. Treat Bash/Read/Write/Task names as generic capabilities and use actual Codex shell, file, connector and delegation tools; never assume Claude's MCP names, environment variables, hooks or authentication exist here.

Write reports in the user's language, adapting source-specific English labels when helpful without changing the requested review structure.

## Host adaptations

- ECC 2.2.3 workflow adapted for Antigravity (Argon 4) and Codex on Unaware of My Demise. Resolve relative `references/`, `templates/`, `examples/` and `scripts/` paths against `.claude/skills/eval-harness/`.
- Map generic Claude tool names (`Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Task`) to actual Antigravity/Codex tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_command`, `search_web`, `invoke_subagent`). Never assume ECC's background hook daemon (`hooks.json`) or retired Context7 MCP is active.
- Preserve UOMD architecture: pure PixiJS v8 + Gothic DOM/CSS UI (`apps/game`), React Control Center (`apps/admin`), Cloudflare Workers + Hono + D1 SQLite only (`apps/api`), Capacitor 8 Android (`apps/android`).
- Follow D-28 delivery rules: verify changes locally (`npm run verify`) and create reviewable local commits only; never `git push` or deploy Workers from an agent session.

If a source instruction conflicts with these host adaptations, use the adaptation for Codex while retaining the source's technical/safety constraints. Do not rewrite the canonical Claude skill. See [Codex setup and catalog](../../../docs/CODEX_SKILLS.md) for runtime verification and refresh instructions.
